# 🕵️‍♂️ Crime Data Analysis in India using Power BI

This project presents an interactive dashboard for analyzing crime statistics across Indian cities using **Power BI**. The goal is to visualize, interpret, and derive actionable insights from crime data based on multiple demographic and geographic factors.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dashboard is built to provide a visual representation of crime data categorized by:

- Type of crime (e.g., kidnapping, crimes against women and children)
- Gender of the victim
- Geographic location (city-level)
- Year of report (filter-enabled)
- Victim age group (filter-enabled)

The analysis spans data from **29 cities**, offering a regional perspective on crime trends.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify cities with the highest crime rates.
- Analyze gender-based crime distribution.
- Examine the geographical spread of crime incidents.
- Compare average crime rates for different offenses.
- Understand victim trends by age and gender.

## 🛠 Methodology

- **Data Source**: Public repositories
- **Data Cleaning**: Null values and inconsistencies removed using Excel.
- **Data Visualization**: Created using Power BI with a range of visuals:
  - KPI Cards
  - Line and Bar Charts
  - Donut Charts
  - Geo Maps
- **DAX Measures**: Used for custom calculations such as average crime rate, total crime reports, and gender-specific statistics.

## 📌 Key Metrics

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Total Crime` | Shows overall number of crimes |
| `Total Crime Reports` | Counts total number of crime report entries |
| `Avg Rape Rate` | Compares rape crime rates across states |
| `Crime Rate Against Women` | Average rate of crimes targeting women |
| `Total Crimes by Gender` | Distribution of crimes based on victim gender |

## 📈 Visuals in the Dashboard

1. **KPI Cards**: Overview of major statistics (e.g., 40.16K total reports, 22.42K against women).
2. **Line Chart**: Comparison of average crime rates across different offenses by city.
3. **Geo Map**: Geographic distribution of average crime reports.
4. **Bar Chart**: Top 5 cities with the highest number of reports (e.g., Surat, Visakhapatnam).
5. **Donut Chart**: Crime distribution by gender.
6. **Combo Chart**: Gender-wise victim count and average crime rate in top 7 cities.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Surat** reported the highest number of cases (1111).
- Crimes against women are significantly higher compared to other categories.
- Female victims represent over **54%** of all reported cases.
- Crime trends vary considerably across cities like Rajkot, Srinagar, and Thane.
- Northern and western regions of India show higher crime densities.

## ✅ Tools Used

- **Power BI**: Main tool for visualization
- **Microsoft Excel**: Preprocessing and data cleaning
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For custom metrics
- **Map Visuals**: For geospatial analysis

## 🧠 Conclusion

This project illustrates how data visualization can support crime analysis by transforming raw data into meaningful patterns and trends. Power BI enables deeper exploration into crime dynamics, helping inform decisions for public safety and crime prevention strategies.
